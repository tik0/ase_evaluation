# tracking

Create a folder with your robots name and push the tracking folders with their timestamp names into it.
Please do only push the .txt files, and maybe a README.md file with some further discription concerning the tracking.

## The tracking files are organized as follows

Name: `CAMERA_<number>_tracking_data.txt`

Content of each line: `<timestamp> <Is valid tracking> <orientation in degree> <x direction> <y direction>`
